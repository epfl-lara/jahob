% New BibTeX file for Martin Rinard's group.
% This file should supercede the(*) p.bib one day...
% (*)Radu said it should be called "the" p.bib, not just p.bib! :)

  ABSTRACT     = {We provide a resolution-based proof procedure for modal,
     description and hybrid logic that improves on previous proposals in 
     important ways. It avoids translations into large undecidable logics,
     and works directly on modal, description or hybrid logic formulas instead.
     In addition, by using the hybrid machinery it avoids the complexities 
     of earlier propositional resolution-based methods for modal logic.
     It combines ideas from the method of prefixes used in tableaux,
     and resolution ideas in such a way that some of the heuristics 
     and optimizations devised in either field are applicable}

        abstract = {We define order locality
to be a property of clauses relative
to a term ordering.   This property is a kind of
generalization of the subformula property for proofs where 
the terms appearing in proofs can be bounded,
under the given ordering,
by terms appearing in the goal clause.  We show that when a clause set is
order local, then the complexity of its ground entailment problem is
a function of its structure (e.g., full versus Horn clauses),
and the ordering used.   We prove that, in many cases, order locality
is equivalent to a clause set being saturated 
under ordered resolution.  This provides a means of using standard
resolution theorem provers for testing order locality and
transforming non-local clause sets into local ones.   
We have used the Saturate system to automatically establish complexity
bounds for a number of nontrivial entailment problems
relative to complexity classes which include polynomial and
exponential time and co-NP.

                   algebra of binary relations.  It attempts to unify functional
                   and logic programming, retaining the advantages of both, and
                   avoiding some of the problems.  It has all the features needed
                   of a programming language, and a straightforward semantic
                   interpretation.  Since program specifications are easily
                   expressed as relations, it offers a simple path from a
                   specification to a program and from the program to its proof
                   of correctness.  The algebra of binary relations has several
                   operators whose effects are like those of familiar procedural
                   language constructs, for example, relational composition is
                   analogous to sequential execution. The Libra language is
                   illustrated by its application to a simple programming exercise.
                   Some conclusions are drawn.}

set of formulas that do not contain function symbols,
that possibly contain equality, and that contain at
most two variables. This paper shows how resolution
theorem-proving techniques can be used to provide an 
algorithm for deciding whether or not any given formula 
in the two-variable fragment is satisfiable. Previous
resolution-based techniques could deal only with the 
equality-free subset of the two-variable fragment. },
