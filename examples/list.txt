Bugs
====

*cyclic-dll _INIT fails

*when verifying e.g. loopinvs/gtree some z3 processes are left dangling even without forking, so they consume uselessly other CPUs

*mona interface does not seem to work with forking on e.g. gtree

*in loopinvs/gtree/run-mona the obligation SubtreeChange fails with all provers, and presumably it verified before, try this:

../../../bin/jahob.opt MonaTree.java -method Tree.removeMin -timeout 60 -sastvc -failfast -assert SubtreeChange -usedp mona z3 e spass cvcl isa

Issues/TODO
===========

*check loopinvs directory

*loopinvs/DLLSet does not have tree[...] invariant but uses rtrancl, so I think it was used to test interpreter only.

*look at Jame, Dijkstra

*complete containers/sorted/SortedListVC to make it a useful data structure?

*complex conditional assignments don't work so we need havoc+assume in
   containers/instantiable/list-cursor/removeCurrent

*hash table got broken by slight vcgen change?
 (note need SPASS-2.2, as 3.0 gets confused by 'div')

*make countKeys work for AssocList using BAPA

*verifying functionalness of hashtable compute_hash

*reentrancy story

Comments
========

*I don't see big differences between sll and containers/instantiable/list-data but the identifier names and slightly differerent preconditions.  
*loopinvs/array seems subsumed by loopinvs/java.util/ArrayList


Description of examples that we got running
===========================================

Lists
-----

./containers/instantiable/list-data/

  Instantiable linked list with data elements, add and remove operations.
  verified using first-order provers thanks to ghost fields

./containers/instantiable/list-cursor/

  Instantiable linked list with data elements and a cursor.
  Many consequences of invariants had to be added.
  Proof decomposition (currently unchecked) using havoc,assume etc.

./containers/array/

  Global set implemented as an array, with operations 'add' and 'contains'.

./examples/loopinvs/BH/

  the invariant ChildrenAdvInjInv must be proved manually, but otherwise works


Trees
-----

Hash tables
-----------

./containers/vs_hashtable/

 instantiable hash table on top of immutable assoc list, 
 works with SPASS-2.2 (not 3.0 due to 'div' keyword), 
 we assume hash function spec
 (would need dependence analysis and special treatment to remove that assumption)
