Hi Viktor,

The specifications we used were Kodkod formulas automatically
generated from the JML List specification:
  http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/JML-release/javadocs/java/util/List.html

This Java file contains the code to construct the Kodkod specifications:
  http://tekton.csail.mit.edu/ListCheck.java

The method 'addSpec', for example, constructs and returns the Kodkod
specification for the List.add(Object) method. You should be able to
ignore most of the file and just look at the methods like 'addSpec',
'removeSpec', etc. Below each of the automatically generated
specifications, you'll find in comments a simpler specification that I
generated by hand. The relations 'preAbs' and 'postAbs' represent the
abstract pre- and post-states of the list, respectively. They are
binary, functional relations mapping integers to objects.

We checked all the list implementations in this zip file, except for
Basic4, because that has a seeded bug in the equals method, which
wasn't part of our experiment. Only BasicList.java should verify --
the rest were seeded with bugs:
  http://tekton.csail.mit.edu/basic.zip

We looked at the AbstractLinkedList and NodeCachingLinkedList
implementations from the Apache Commons-Collections library but found
no bugs:
  http://tekton.csail.mit.edu/commons-src.zip

We found lots of bugs in an early version of the GNU Trove library:
  http://tekton.csail.mit.edu/trove-0.1.2.zip

And we found one intentional specification violation and one true bug
in the latest version of the GNU Trove library:
  http://tekton.csail.mit.edu/trove-1.1b4.zip

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Greg
