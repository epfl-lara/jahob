The intended meaning of different operations on cardinalities is the following:

cardinality(S) is just the cardinality of a set S.
cardeq(S,k) (where S is a set and k is an integer constant) holds if and only if the cardinality of S is exactly k.
cardleq(S,k) (where S is a set and k is an integer constant) holds if and only if the cardinality of S is at most k.
cardgeq(S,k) (where S is a set and k is an integer constant) holds if and only if the cardinality of S is at least k.

The meaning of Binder(Comprehension,[x1;...;xn],f) is {(x1,...,xn) | f}.
